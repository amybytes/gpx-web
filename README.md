# GPX Web
This is a GUI application for interacting with files in the [GPX file format](https://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) using a web interface. It was created for my CIS\*2750 (Software Systems Development and Integration) class.

The [A4 branch](https://github.com/rowak/gpx-web/tree/A4) is the latest version.
